# HTML-CSS-Project-1
A crochet brand website that I am continuously improving as I learn and apply new HTML & CSS concepts.

This project is not just a website — it represents my hands-on frontend learning journey, design thinking, and problem-solving growth.

While AI tools can generate layouts and code instantly, this website reflects the human process behind development — understanding structure, debugging errors, refining UI, and making intentional design choices.

Through this project, I aim to show that AI is a powerful assistant, but creativity, logic building, and real understanding come from consistent practice. My goal is not to compete with AI, but to learn deeply enough to use it effectively — and prove that web developers evolve alongside AI, not get replaced by it
